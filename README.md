# Number-Plate-Detection
Train an object detection model to extract bounding boxes of number plate on the car. Dataset consists of images of cars with number plates with annotations in Pascal VOC format. Goal of the problem is to acheive mAP of atleast 70%.
The trained model should run on cpu (x86-64) with minimum of 5FPS on i5 cpus and 10FPS on i7cpus. (No GPU is to be used for inference)
